# Linear Perceptron Model

## [About the Model](NB_Report.pdf)

## Using the Model

1. Create a conda environment and install all dependencies

```sh
# Create environment and Install Dependencies
conda create -n ml python=3.9 jupyter numpy pandas

# Activate Environment
conda activate ml
```

2. Using the Jupyter Notebook
   
   - Start a Jupyter Notebook Instance and open [NB_from_scratch.ipynb](NB_from_scratch.ipynb) in the Jupyter File explorer
        ```sh
        jupyter-notebook
        ``` 
    - Run all Cells from the top in sequential Order
    - 7 Fold Cross Validation Accuracies and Average Accuracy are in the last cell
